# TEnmo 

This is my second capstone project from Tech Elevator.

Built a secure money transfer simulation API similar to Venmo, using MVC pattern and REST. 
Server-side is powered by Spring framework and incorporates PostgreSQL. Security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication and authorization.
